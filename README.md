# 5th Edition of HackDays - DS Community

Imagine FashionLine, a clothing store making waves in the U.S. However, success comes with challenges: maintaining product quality, ensuring customer satisfaction, and keeping internal systems running smoothly.

As more customers flock to buy, more issues arise. The company needs to create products customers truly desire, target the right audience for marketing, and deal with systems that might crash under high traffic. The solution? Form a "War Room" team—specialists from different areas working together to enhance the customer experience.

This is where the **Esposa do Kuririn** team shines. They were crowned champions in this Kaggle competition, and they deserve all the applause! As for us, **SOL_Dados**, we secured an admirable 12th place. While we didn’t clinch the top spot, the journey was immensely educational. Competing with such talented and inspiring teams was a privilege.

Our solution focused on customer satisfaction. Using binary classification machine learning algorithms, we measured each customer's satisfaction level. By predicting whether a customer would be "Satisfied" or "Neutral/Unsatisfied," we identified those who needed special attention.

This competition wasn’t just about winning—it was an opportunity to learn. By analyzing the winning notebook from the **Esposa do Kuririn** team, we expanded our knowledge and understood what made them the best.

If you're curious, we’ve made our notebooks available, including the winning one from **Esposa do Kuririn**, as well as our submission. In the DS Community, sharing knowledge is key, and we want to contribute to this exchange. You can check out the competition [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions).

This event reminds us that learning is the ultimate reward. Let’s celebrate every step of this incredible learning journey in the DS Community. 🚀📊🏆
